Description: MIDI connection minder & viewer
 Keeps track of connections between MIDI ports (hardware & software alike).
 If those connections are lost because the hardware disconnects, or the
 software exits, this service will re-make the connections once the ports
 return to the system.
 .
 A configuration of connections can also be stored in a file, and loaded
 at any time, causing the ports to be reconnected according to easy to write
 rules.
 .
 Includes the utility command, midiwala, which provides a clear view of the
 ports and connections, and can make and break connections easily.
